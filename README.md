# MyCrapPro
it is a test project which implement AngularJs, RequireJs and also use Rich text editor to explain use of it in very simple way.
I have Also added template addition on drag and drop basis.  


This is a Framework design to test new components before implementing in real project. So Pardon UI design.
Have modified RequireJS to load even Link lags dynamically, like JS files. 

Please feel free to provide suggestions for improvement in this 
Thanks
